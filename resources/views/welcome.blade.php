                <p>I never have been super great at introductions, but hello! I am Maximus Vanhaarlem, 
                    the programmer behind this website here.</p>
                <p>I quite enjoy playing games of all kinds. I am sorta obsessed with D&D, and 
                    have been the DM of my group for over 5 years now. Past that I also enjoy games like Crusader Kings 3, Mount and Blade 
                    Bannerlord, Baldurs Gate 3, Final Fantasy XIV, Rimworld and pretty much any other Sandbox or RPG.</p>
